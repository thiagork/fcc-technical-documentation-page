                    <li>It was developed and released around the year 1972.</li>
                    <li>Most popular Linux Kernel and most UNIX utilities, what you would call the operating system are written in C.</li>
                    <li>C is not an object oriented language so you don’t get distracted by things like inheritance and polymorphism.</li>
                    <li>The C language has formed the basis for many languages including C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Limbo, LPC, C#, PHP, Python, Perl, Verilog, and C-shell.</li>

                    <li>Java was originally designed for interactive TV, but the digital cable industry wasn’t ready for the technology.</li>
